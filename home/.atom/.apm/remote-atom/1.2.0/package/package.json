It transfers files to be edited from remote server using SSH\nport forward and transfers the files back when they are saved.\n\n# Installation\nRemote Atom can be easily installed using the Atom package manager. On the\nremote server, we need to install [rmate](https://github.com/aurora/rmate). It\nis the same executable for TextMate and Sublime Text. You don't have to\ninstall it if your Textmate/Sublime Text alternatives are working. If not, it\ncan be install by running this script (assume that you have the permission),\n\n```bash\ncurl -o /usr/local/bin/rmate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aurora/rmate/master/rmate\nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/rmate\n```\n\nYou can also rename the command to `ratom`\n\n```\nmv /usr/local/bin/rmate /usr/local/bin/ratom\n```\n\n# Usage\n\nOpen your Atom application, go to the menu `Packages -> Remote Atom`,\nand click `Start Server`. Your can also launch the server via command palette.\nThe server can also be configured to be launched at startup in the preference.\n\nThen, open an ssh connection to the remote server with remote port forwarded.\nIt can be done by\n\n```bash\nssh -R 52698:localhost:52698 user@example.com\n```\n\nAfter running the server, you can just open the file on the remote system by\n\n```\nrmate test.txt\n```\n\nIf everything has been setup correctly, your should be able to see the opening file in Atom.\n\n### SSH config\nIt could be tedious to type `-R 52698:localhost:52698` everytime you ssh. To make your\nlife easier, add the following to `~/.ssh/config`,\n\n```\nHost example.com\n    RemoteForward 52698 localhost:52698\n    User user\n```\n\nFrom now on, you only have to do `ssh example.com`.\n\n### Known issues\nSince each window of Atom is a separate instance, the tcp server can only be running\non one window. Therefore, file will only be opened in the window with the server running.\nIf that window is closed, the server can be restarted by clicking\n`Packages -> Remote Atom -> Start Server`.\n\n\n# TODO\n- writing tests","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/randy3k/remote-atom/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/randy3k/remote-atom","_id":"remote-atom@1.2.0","_shasum":"2608f2385451f0a8ac119cbb82bdc4155042f86b","_resolved":"file:../d-115211-29494-1jl2h73/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115211-29494-1jl2h73/package.tgz"}
