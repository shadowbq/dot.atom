You can check that it worked\nby running `$ seeing_is_believing --version`\n\n## Using the default configuration\n\nThis package uses somewhat intelligent defaults,\nbut in reality, it does not know how to find your Ruby, or what settings you want to use.\n**The defaults will only work if you launch atom from the console**\n(this is because it will then inherit your environment variables)\n\n## Custom configuration\n\nTo customize it to always work, regardless of how you start Atom, edit your config file\n(on my Mac, that's at `~/.atom/config.cson`).\nAdd the following keys (as of 0.138.0, they go under 'global', before that,\nyou can just append this to the bottom of the file),\nchanging them as appropriate for your environment,\nand according to your preferences.\n\n[**Here is what my configuration looks like**](https://gist.github.com/JoshCheek/ff2a4e82587b68f3b190)\n\n**Here are the configuraiton options you can set**\n\nDescriptions of the variables are below.\n\n```coffeescript\n'seeing-is-believing':\n  'ruby-command': 'path/to/your/ruby'\n  'add-to-env':\n    \"SOME_KEY\":    \"SOME_VALUE\"\n    \"ADD_TO_PATH\": \"dir1:dir2\"\n  'flags': [\n      '--alignment-strategy', 'chunk',\n      '--number-of-captures', '300',\n      '--line-length',        '1000',\n      '--timeout',            '12'\n  ]\n```\n\n### ruby-command\n\n`ruby-command` is the location of the ruby program you want to run.\n\n**rvm** You need to [make a wrapper](https://rvm.io/integration/textmate),\nan executable that sets everything up for you. Run `rvm list strings` to see\nwhat versions you have available, then `$ rvm wrapper YOUR_VERSION sib`, e.g.\n`$ rvm wrapper ruby-2.0.0-p481 sib`. Now, set your `ruby-command` to\nwhatever `$ which sib_ruby` tells you.\n\n**rbenv** set it to whatever `$ which ruby` tells you\n\n**chruby** You can set it to whatever `$ which ruby` tells you,\nand then set environment variables as described below,\nor you can make your own wrapper like [this](https://github.com/JoshCheek/dotfiles/blob/c307d7c0af66c616281c82b48f0f28d3ea190a40/bin/sib_ruby),\nand then set it to the path to that wrapper.\n\n\n### add-to-env\n\nHere, you can specify environment variables.\n\n**rvm** If you used the wrapper approach above, then you don't need any environment variables.\n\n**rbenv** You need to set `RBENV_VERSION`,\nyou can see what your it should be with `$ env | grep RBENV_VERSION`.\nIf you don't have anything there, you can do `$ rbenv versions` to see a list of possibilities\n(remember, you need SiB installed for that Ruby). I recently set the value to `2.1.1` for someone,\nand set their `ruby-command` to `/Users/username/.rbenv/shims/ruby`, which worked correctly.\n\n**chruby** If you made your own wrapper above, you don't need to do anything here.\nOtherwise, chruby requires a lot of variables,\nlook in your current environment to see what they should be.\n[Here is an example](https://github.com/JoshCheek/atom-seeing-is-believing/blob/d271293ee62deb3f7748ce2fa5343b1efc4a50de/lib/seeing-is-believing.coffee#L54-65)\nthat worked for me.\nIt might also be worth setting your SHELL environment variable\nto bash, otherwise [this](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby/blob/dadcdba85e50fd2b62930d6bb7835972873f879b/bin/chruby-exec#L36)\ncould fuck up (e.g. I set mine to fish for other packages that actually launch a shell,\nwhich causes, this to happen).\n\n\n### modifying the path\nTo add paths, use the environment variable `ADD_TO_PATH` (this will go in `add-to-env` key)\n\n**rvm** you should be fine\n\n**rbenv** You might need to set it to `/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/.rbenv/shims` I'm not sure.\n\n**chruby** If you used the wrapper above, you don't need to do anything here.\nOtherwise, run `env | grep PATH` and set it to whatever you think was added by chruby.\nYou can look at [my example](https://github.com/JoshCheek/atom-seeing-is-believing/blob/d271293ee62deb3f7748ce2fa5343b1efc4a50de/lib/seeing-is-believing.coffee#L54-65)\nto see what I wound up adding.\n\n\n### flags\n\nYou can get a full list of flags by running `seeing_is_believing --help`\nThe most common and useful ones are going to be:\n\n* \"--alignment-strategy\" (I recommend \"chunk\")\n* \"--number-of-captures\" (say you have a line that executes in a loop, 1 million times,\n  you don't want to record all 1 million of those invocations, because it's too much information,\n  it would eat up your memory, maybe start paging, and just generally take a really long time to execute)\n* '--line-length' (how much output to show, use this to keep it from affecting editor performance or getting too spammy)\n* '--timeout' (say you accidentally have an infinite loop... don't want to wait around forever!)\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n* Do you have the gem installed in the correct environment? (load your env in whatever way you do that, and then `gem which seeing_is_believing`)\n* Do you have the package installed? (Command+Shift+P and start typing \"seeing\", you should see the commands and be able to run them from there)\n* What do the logs say? (use Command+Option+I to run the console, the package will print some debugging information you can look at)\n* Did Atom get really messed up after you installed this? Probably the `~/.atom/config.cson` has a syntax error or something, which will mess up all the configuration, not just Seeing Is Believing's\n\n## <a href=\"http://www.wtfpl.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.wtfpl.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/wtfpl.svg\" height=\"20\" alt=\"WTFPL\" /></a> License\n\n    Copyright (C) 2014 Josh Cheek <josh.cheek@gmail.com>\n\n    This program is free software.
