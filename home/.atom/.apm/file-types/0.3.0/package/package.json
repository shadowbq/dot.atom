Most JavaScript regular\nexpressions should work; but, the system looks for a dot (`.`), a caret (`^`) at\nthe start, or a dollar (`$`) to identify RegExp matchers.\n\nFor example, you can associate `/.*_steps\\.rb$/` with `source.cucumber.steps` in\nyour `config.cson` as follows:\n\n```cson\n'file-types':\n  '_steps\\\\.rb$': 'source.cucumber.steps'\n```\n\n*NOTE:* Extension Matchers take priority over RegExp Matchers.\n\n# Caveats\n\nYou probably don't want to assign the same file type to multiple languages...\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/execjosh/atom-file-types/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/execjosh/atom-file-types","_id":"file-types@0.3.0","_shasum":"913b4c5b777c9362dd1ef918329d0a06154419b2","_resolved":"file:../d-115225-30746-1d2z8xe/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115225-30746-1d2z8xe/package.tgz"}
