It was originally a vim theme, but it's grown from \nthere.\n\n![screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/F9fHfwh.jpg)\n\n## Licensing\n\nThis theme for Atom is based on \n[Colin T.A. Gray's version](https://github.com/colinta/zenburn) for TextMate.\n\nLike it, it's released under the terms of the MIT license.\n\n## Language Support\n\nI've not tested it with anything except Ruby and Markdown, and both seem to\nwork fine. Because it's a conversion theme, everything that was supported in\nTextMate should be supported in Atom.\n\n","_id":"zenburn@2.0.2","_shasum":"051f6540e61f1be00fb6e70f4fb2b3b041e0cfd7","_resolved":"file:../d-115211-29202-1myui35/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115211-29202-1myui35/package.tgz"}
