Inspired by [Sublime Test Ruby-Test](https://github.com/maltize/sublime-text-2-ruby-tests).\n\n![Ruby Quick Test screenshot](https://raw.github.com/philnash/ruby-quick-test/master/screenshots/ruby-quick-test-demo.png)\n\n## Installing\n\nUse the Atom package manager, which can be found in the Settings view or run apm install ruby-quick-test from the command line.\n\n## Usage\n\nRuby Quick Test can be used to quickly run a test file with a file name that matches the pattern `/_(test|spec)\\.rb$/` or `/.(feature)$/`. Test files ending in `_test.rb` will be run using the `ruby` command, files ending `_spec.rb` will be run with the `rspec` command and files ending `.feature` will be run with the `cucumber` command.\n\nWhen the active editor is using such a file, you can run the tests with the key combination `cmd-ctrl-t` or by using the command palette (`cmd-shift-p`).\n\nThis currently doesn't cover `MiniTest::Spec` style files, but support is planned for those soon.\n\n### Commands\n\n* `cmd-ctrl-t` - Run the current test file\n* `cmd-ctrl-e` - Re-run the previous test file\n* `cmd-ctrl-x` - Show/hide the test panel\n\n## Todo\n\n* Tests!\n* `MiniTest::Spec` support\n* Support for running individual tests\n* Run the entire test suite using `rake test`, `rake spec` or `rake cucumber`\n* [Issues/pull requests](https://github.com/philnash/ruby-quick-test/issues) welcome\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"ruby-quick-test@0.3.0","_shasum":"304cd5519b5ef57bf6f338cc62d508ede420954b","_resolved":"file:../d-115215-3104-j4cz5a/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115215-3104-j4cz5a/package.tgz"}
