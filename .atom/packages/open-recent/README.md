## Settings

* `maxRecentFiles` and `maxRecentDirectories` limit the number of items in the menu.
* `replaceNewWindowOnOpenDirectory` When true, opening a recent directory will "open" in the current window, but only if the window does not have a project path set. Eg: The window that appears when doing File > New Window.
* `replaceProjectOnOpenDirectory` When true, opening a recent directory will "open" in the current window, replacing the current project.
* `listDirectoriesAddedToProject` When true, the all root directories in a project will be added to the history and not just the 1st root directory.
