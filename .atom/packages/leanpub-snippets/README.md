## Markdown snippets for Leanpub in Atom Editor

I've created these snippets for Leanpub authors to quickly insert blocks of Leanpub friendly markdown into book manuscript using Atom editor.

## Installation and Usage

Install this package from Atom package manager and restart Atom editor.

Try out typing 'lp-tip' in any Markdown file and pressing 'Tab' key on your keyboard. You should get the following code generated for you:
```
T> ## 
T>
T> 
```

You can use the following snippets :

- lp-img (insert image with caption)
- lp-code (insert a code block)
- lp-aside (insert aside)
- lp-info (insert info block)
- lp-error (insert error block)
- lp-question (insert question block)
- lp-tip (insert tip block)
- lp-discussion (insert discussion block)

Enjoy!
